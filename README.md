# Predicting length of stay at RI Hospital

Predicting a patient’s length of stay (LOS) in a hospital setting has been widely researched. Accurately predicting an individual’s LOS can have a significant impact on a healthcare provider’s ability to care for individuals by allowing them to properly prepare and manage resources. A hospital’s productivity requires a delicate balance of maintaining enough staffing and resources without being overly equipped or wasteful. This has become of even more important in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, during which Emergency Departments around the globe have been inundated with patients and are struggling to manage their resources.

We study the performances of multiple predictive models in predicting the length of stay at RI Hospitals. The effect of resampling techniques on model performances is also analyzed.
